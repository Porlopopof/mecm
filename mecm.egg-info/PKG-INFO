        =================
        
        
        This package provides an implementation of the modified expectation maximization
        algorithm developed by Q. Baghi, for which a reference can be found in
        https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08530
        
        
        
        Short Description
        -----------------
        
        The MECM package is a tool to perform gaussian linear regressions on time series affected
        by colored stationary noise and missing data. It is based on an algorithm close to the
        expectation-maximization, which is efficiently implemented by taking advantage of fast
        Fourier transforms, fast matrix-to-vector multiplications, and sparse linear algebra.
        
        Let's consider a data model that can be written on the form:
        
        $y = A*beta + n$
        
        where:
        
          * y is the measured time series data (size N), evenly sampled.
          * A is the design matrix (size N x K)
          * beta is the vector of parameters to estimate (size K)
          * n is the noise vector, assumed to follow a Gaussian stationary distribution
          with a given smooth spectral density S(f)
        
        Now assume that only some entries of the vector y are observed.
        
        The main methods of the package are:
        
          * maxlike: quasi-maximum likelihood estimation with missing data for gaussian
        stationary models of the form $y = A*beta + epsilon$
        
          * PSD_estimate: a class to perform power spectral density estimation with local
        linear smoothers.
        
          * conditionalDraw: a function computing the conditional expectation of the
        missing data conditionally on the observed data, assuming a Gaussian stationary
        model.

        Quick start guide
        -----------------
        
        MECM can be basically used to perform any multilinear regression analysis where
        the distribution of the noise is assumed to be Gaussian and stationary in the
        wide sense.
